# tracing-atrace

Support for logging [`tracing`][tracing] events natively to linux kernel debug tracing.

[crates-url]: https://crates.io/crates/tracing-atrace

## Overview

[`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
scoped, structured, and async-aware diagnostics. `tracing-atrace` provides a
[`tracing-atrace::Layer`][layer] implementation for logging `tracing` spans
and events to [`linux kernel debug tracing`][kernel debug], on Linux
distributions that use debugfs.
 
*Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.40+][msrv]*

[msrv]: #supported-rust-versions
[`tracing`]: https://crates.io/crates/tracing

## Supported Rust Versions

Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is 1.40. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on Rust
versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio
project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor
versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable
compiler version is 1.45, the minimum supported version will not be increased
past 1.42, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler
version is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies
with this policy.

## How To try tracing-atrace.<only for linux>
### 1.first compile tracing-atrace.
```
$cargo build
```

### 2.check your linux kernel support debugfs or not
```
$sudo umount debugfs

$sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/

$sudo mount -t debugfs -o rw,mode=777,remount /sys/kernel/debug/

$sudo chmod -R 777 /sys/kernel/debug
```

### 3.run app example chat
```
// one chat server
$cargo run --example chat
or
$cd target/debug/examples && ./chat

// as chat client and enter key.
$telnet localhost 6142
```

### 4.run atrace to get chat's tracing log.
```
// normal capture
$./atrace -T 10 > trace.log

// capture compress atrace log
$./atrace -T 30 -Z > atrace.log.z

// uncompress atrace log
$./atrace -d atrace.log.z > atrace.log
```

### 5.view tracing log
open chrome browser,and enter chrome://tracing in url address.

in its load button, select your trace.log, you'll get your tracing result.

chat tracing result example:

### 6.atrace options found in help
```
$./atrace --help

// capture cpu schedule infos.
// it'll have big size log file with cpu scheduleinfos.
$./atrace -T 30 -Z --CPU_SCHED > atrace.log.z
```
